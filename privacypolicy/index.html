        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Sunqueas Media Trust ABN 56 495 155 145 (an entity domiciled in Australia and through which all of
          Sunqueas' operations run through) is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines
          our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.</p>

        <p>We have adopted the <i>Australian Privacy Principles</i> (<b>APPs</b>) contained in the <i>Privacy Act
            1988</i> (Cth) (the <b>Privacy Act</b>). The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose, store,
          secure, and dispose of your Personal Information. </p>

        <p>A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Australian
          Information Commissioner at <a href="https://www.aoic.gov.au/">aoic.gov.au</a>.</p>

        <h3>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h3>
        <p>Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal
          Information we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses, phone, and facsimile numbers.</p>

        <p>This Personal Information is obtained in many ways including interviews, correspondence, by telephone and
          facsimile, by email, via our website <a href="https://sunqueas.xyz/">sunqueas.xyz</a>, from media and
          publications, from other publicly available sources, from cookies, and from third parties. We don't guarantee
          website links or policy of authorised third parties.</p>

        <p>We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing
          information to our clients, and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes
          closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use or
          disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing.</p>

        <p>When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we are
          collecting the information and how we plan to use it.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive information</h3>
        <p>Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such things as an
          individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or
          philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record, or health
          information.</p>

        <p>Sensitive information will be used by us only:
        <ul>
          <li>for the primary purpose for which it was obtained;</li>
          <li>for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose;</li>
          <li>with your consent; or</li>
          <li>where required or authorised by law.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Third parties</h3>
        <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. However,
          in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take
          reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed in a number of circumstances including the following:
        <ul>
          <li>third parties where you consent to the use or disclosure; and</li>
          <li>where required or authorised by law.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from
          unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the
          purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your
          Personal Information. However, most of the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which
          will be kept by us for a minimum of seven&nbsp;(7) years.</p>

          charge any fee for your access request, but may charge an administrative fee for providing a copy of your
          Personal Information.</p>

        <p>In order to protect your Personal Information we may require identification from you before releasing the
          requested information.</p>

        <h3>Maintaining the quality of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>It is an important to us that your Personal Information is up to date. We will take reasonable steps to make
          sure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If you find that the information we
